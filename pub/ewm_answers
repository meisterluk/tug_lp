    3. Key Performance Indicators on a Balanced Scorecard
    4. Codify the current Knowledge Area Status in an AS-IS-profile
    5. Comparison of target achievement to necessary effort for each current ongoing KM activity (KM Status).
    6. Identify gaps in the area of KM activities
    7. Collection and prioritizing identified KM measures to their contribution to the KM Maturity and necessary effort.

    Databases enable us to structure information. Databases considered in a tabular representation organize objects per row and attributes per column. Data is cleaned up. Constraints define possible ranges of values. In difference an information space is organized in bags (media, documents, websites) unstructured and range of values is not predefined. Data is often not "clean".
