Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy
=======================================

Topic 1: Infinity
-----------------

Premises used to derive a conclusion.
Paradoxon: Premises used to derive an invalid/confusing conclusion.

Zeno's paradoxon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Achilles and the tortoise: Achilles will not overtake the tortoise.

Sets
~~~~

* Sequence of elements.
* elements are distinct.
* order of elements is irrelevant.

Principle of Extensionality:
  Two sets are identical iff they have the same members.

Topic. Subset and proper subset relations.

* If X is a proper subset of Y, X has less members than Y.
* If there is a pairing off between the members X and Y, X and Y have the same number of members.

Topic. Ambiguity.
Topic. Cantor's theorem.

Those definitions contradict if applied to infinite sets.
We need differentitation.

Equal Size (Equinumerosity, Equipollence):
  For all sets X and Y: X has equally₂ many members as Y iff there is a pairing off between the members of X and those of Y.
Smaller Size:
  For all sets X and Y: X has less₂ members than Y iff X has equally₂ many members as a proper subset of Y, but X does not have equally₂ many members as Y.
Infinity and Finiteness:
  For all sets X: X is infinite₂ iff X has equally₂ many members as a proper subset of X.
  X is finite₂ if and only if X is not infinite₂.

The set of natural numbers has less members than the set of real numbers.

We have definitions at several levels for infinity.

Topic. Absolute infinity.

Topic 2: Truth
--------------

"A descriptive sentence or a proposition is true if and only if it corresponds to reality."
Is this a valid statement?

    "In order be satisfactory, a definition of truth has to be formally correct and materially adequate."
    "What is truth?"
    -- Alfred Tarski

	"To say of what is that it is, or of what is not it is not, is true"
	-- Aristoteles in Metaphysics
	corresponds to truth scheme: (A and 'A' is true) or (not A and 'A' is not true).

The Truth scheme does not tell us how to create sentences that do not involve the truth predicate.

Material adequacy:

	A definition of truth for the descriptive sentences of a language L is materially adequate if and only if the definition implies all truth equivalences, that is, all instances of the truth scheme.
	  (T) 'A' is true if and only if A
	in which the placeholder 'A' is replaced by an arbitrary descriptive sentence in the lanugage L.

Topic. L_simple language. L_simple has a names, has predicates, has logical symbols and is defined recursively.

Topic. Recursive definitions. Consistency is ensured if all statements are derived from valid axioms.

Complete induction over natural numbers:
	0 has the property P.
	for all natural numbers n: if n has property P, than n+1 has property P.
	
	Therefore all natural numbers have property P.

Topic. Liar paradoxon. We can derive a sentence which is an instance of the truth scheme and a sentence equates to the negation of this sentence.

Distinction between to 2 languages at different levels:

Object language
  the language for which truth is defined.
Meta language
  the language in which one defines truth for the object language.

We can use the truth predicate ("A is true") only in the meta language. So no sentence containing the truth predicate is part of the object language L_simple.
Object language and meta language is a hierarchy of two levels, but we can derive a meta-meta language as well and as such infinitely many.

Topic 3: Propositions
---------------------

1. Fear, hope, desire, … are all instances of different attitudes, but they direct towards propositions as their content.
   Several descriptive sentences can express the same proposition (meaning of the sentence).
2. Propositions are bearers of truth values.
3. They are the contents of belief.

Truth value depends on the world we are looking at.

ID of worlds
  For all possible worlds w, for all possible worlds w': w = w' if and only if for all propositions X: X is true at w if and only if X is true at w'
ID of propositions
  For all possible propositions X, for all possible propositions Y: X = Y if and only if for all possible worlds w: X is true at w if and only if Y is true at w.

Let W be a given non-empty set of possible worlds:
1. X is a proposition (over W) iff X is a subset of W.
2. If X is a proposition (over W) and w is a world in W, then X is true at w iff w is a member of X.

So we get:

ID of worlds
  For all possible worlds w, for all possible worlds w': w = w' if and only if for all subsets X of W: w is a member of X if and only if w' is a member of X.
ID of propositions
  For all possible propositions X, for all possible propositions Y: X = Y if and only if for all members w of W: w is a member of X if and only if w is a member of Y.

Topic. Negation, Conjunction, Disjunction.

:Negation:		Complement
:Conjunction:   Intersection
:Disjunction:   Union

Prop(not A) = not Prop(A) = W \ Prop(A)

Topic 4: Rational Belief
------------------------

1. If a person is inferentially perfectly rational (with W as her set of entertainable possible worlds), then she believes W.
2. If a person is inferentially perfectly rational, then she does not believe {}.
3. If a person if inferentially perfectly rational, if she believes X and if X is a subset of Y, then she also believes Y.
4. If a person if inferentially perfectly rational, if she believes X and if she believes Y, then she also believes X ∩ Y.

Belief B_W. If X is a proposition (a subset of W), then there are three possible cases:
* B_W is a subset of X - X is believed.
* B_W ∩ X = {} - ¬X is believed.
* B_W is not a subset of X, so B_W ∩ X ≠ {} - Neither X nor ¬X is believed.

Rational Degree of Belief #1
  If a person is inferentially perfectly rational (with W as her set of entertainable possible worlds), then her degree of belief function P is such that: P(W) = 1.
Rational Degree of Belief #2
  If a person is inferentially perfectly rational (with W as her set of entertainable possible worlds), then her degree of belief function P is such that: for all propositions X (for all subsets X of W): P(X) is a real number such that 0 ≤ P(X) ≤ 1.
Rational Degree of Belief #3
  If a person is inferentially perfectly rational (with W as her set of entertainable possible worlds), then her degree of belief function P is such that: for all propositions X (for all subsets X of W), for all propositions Y (for all subsets Y of W): if X ∩ Y = {}, then P(X ∪ Y) = P(X) + P(Y)

Topic. Subjective probability.

P(¬X) = 1 - P(X).
P({}) = 0.
P(Y) = P(X ∩ Y) + P(¬X ∩ Y).
If X is a subset of Y, then P(X) ≤ P(Y).

Assumptions about a lottery:
	P1. P(not(ticket #1 wins) ∧ not(ticket #2 wins) ∧ not(ticket #3 wins) ∧ …) = 0
	P2. P(ticket #1 wins) = 1/N, P(ticket #2 wins) = 1/N, …
	P3. For every proposition X: I believe X if and only if P(X) ≥ 0.9
	P4. For every proposition X, for every proposition Y: if I believe X and I believe Y, then (if I am perfectly rational) I also believe X ∧ Y.
    P5. For every proposition X, P(¬X) = 1 - P(X).
This is a contradiction.

Conclusion:
1. We represented propositions in set theory.
2. We analyzed rationality of belief with basic principles of rational belief.
3. We postulated: Rational degrees of belief corresponds to probabilities.

It is open in our discussion, what the set of possible worlds actually is → Metaphysics.

Topic 5: Conditionals
---------------------

Distinction between subjunctive ("If Oswald had not killed Kennedy, someone else would have") and indicative ("If Oswald did not kill Kennedy, someone else did").

Topic. Relation to set theory.

	For all sentences y of L, for all sentences z of L, if x is the result of putting together 'if', with y, with 'then', and with z, then x is true if and only if y is not true or z is true.

For a conditional proposition:
	1. Take the individual probabilities in probability space.
	2. Given a condition X, set all probabilites in (not X) 0.
	3. Scale all remaining probabilites up to 1 to gain a valid probability space.

Formally,
	Let W be a non-empty, finite set of possible worlds.
	Let P be a probability measure (over W) and assume P to be determined uniquely by B as explained in the previous lecture.
	Then we can define: for all propositions X with P(X) > 0, for all worlds w in W,
	* B_X(w) = 0, iff w is not a member of X
	* B_X(w) = B(w)/P(X), iff w is a member of X

We define a new probability measure:
	P_X(Y) = ∑_(w in Y) B_X(w)
	P_X(Y) = ∑_(w ∈ X ∩ Y) B(W)/P(X) + ∑_(w ∉ X) 0
	
	Thus, for all probability measures P (over W) for all propositions X with P(X) > 0, for all propositions Y:
	P_X(Y) = P(X ∩ Y) / P(X)

Degree of acceptability?
	Given, there is a conditional operation → that can take any two propositions as input which maps them to a proposition as output, and which has the following property:
		For every indicative conditional A → B, where A expresses the proposition X, and B expresses the proposition Y, it holds that:
			A → B expresses the proposition X → Y

	Thesis #1:
	For every indicative conditional A → B where A expresses the proposition X, and B expresses the proposition Y and for every probability measure P on propositions, it holds that:
		The degree of acceptability for the indicative condition A → B (rel. to P) is identical to P(X → Y)
	where X → Y is the proposition expressed by A → B.

	Thesis #2:
	Thus, for every indicative conditional A → B where A expresses the proposition X, and B expresses the proposition Y and for every probability measure P on propositions, it holds that:
		The degree of acceptability for the indicative conditional A → B (rel. to P) is identical to P(Y|X) (or P_X(Y)).

Frank Ramsey
	If two people are arguing "If p will q?" and are both in doubt as to p, they are adding p hypothetically to their stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about q.

Lewis Triviality Theorem on Conditionals:
	Let W be a given non-empty set of possible worlds. By propositions we mean subsets of W again, as usual.
	Assumption #1: There is a conditional operation → that can take any two propositions over W as input and which maps them to a uniquely determined proposition over W as output.
	Assumption #2: Every rational degree of belief function P (on W) is a probability measure.
	Assumption #3: Every rational degree of belief function P (on W) satisfies:
		For all propositions X, Y: P(X → Y) = P(Y|X), where X → Y is as described by Assumption #1.
	Assumption #4: The set of all rational degree of belief functions P (on W) is closed under conditionalization: that is, for every rational degree of belief function P (on W), for every proposition X for which P(X) > 0, the conditionalization P_X of P on X is a rational degree of belief function (on W) as well.

	Conclusion #1: P(Y → Z|X) = P(Z|X ∩ Y)
	Conclusion #2: P(Y → Z) = P(Z)

Thesis #1 and/or Thesis #2 must be invalid.
Are indicative conditionals actually propositions?
We have to distinguish between conditionals in math/logic and natural languages ("a → b" is "not a or b" is fine in math; in language it's not).
"Beliefs in conditionals" != "Conditional beliefs"

Confirmation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

False positives, true negatives.
Hypothesis might explain some behavior but we can never be sure to be right.
Compare the hypothesis in AI learning.
Selecting hypotheses by simplicity.

Bayesian confirmation theory
	Monty Hall Problem
	Bayesian Rule: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
	Rule of Total Probability: P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|¬H) P(¬H)

Monty Hall Problem solved with Bayesian Statistic? see separate bayes_monty_hall.pdf

Topic 6: Utilities
------------------

For modelling the expected utilities:
1. Define acts (what does the actor do to get new probabilities? eg. "switch the door" or "not switch the door" or "buy the lottery ticket").
2. Define outcomes (eg. "get a car", "get a goat", "win the lottery", "lose the lottery")
3. Define the probabilities for a specific act for a specific outcome.

For example,
  Buy ticket, Win: +999$, Lose: -1$
  ie. act, outcome 1, outcome 2
Probabilities:
  Buy ticket, Win: 1%, Lose: 99%
  ie. act, probability of outcome 1, probability of outcome 2

Expected utility:
  0.01 * 999$ + 0.99 * -1$ = 9$
  ie. EU(A) = ∑_(i = 1 to m) P(O_i) * U(O_i)

An act A dominates an act B if and only if the outcome of A will be as good as the outcome of B not matter which state of the world happens to be the true one, and strictly better under at least one state of the world.

Preference:
	A > B: you strictly prefer lottery A to lottery B.
	A ≺ B: you strictly prefer lottery B to lottery A.
	A ~ B: you are indifferent between lotteries A and B.

Von Neumann Morgenstern Axioms:
	Completeness
		For all lotteries A, B in L, A ≻ B or A ≺ B or A ~ B.
	Transitivity
		For all lotteries A, B, C in L, if A ≻ B and B ≻ C, then A ≻ C.
	Continuity
		For all lotteries A, B, C in L, if A ≻ B ≻ C then there are probabilities p and q such that ApC ≻ B ≻ AqC.
	Independence
		For all lotteries A, B, C in L, A ≻ B if and only if ApC ≻ BpC.

The Neumann and Morgenstern representation theorem:
	A preference relation ≻ satisfies the axioms if and only if there exists a utility function u such that
	1. if A ≻ B, then u(A) ≻ u(B)
	2. u(ApB) = p * u(A) + (1 - p) u(B)
	3. for every other function u' that satisfies (1) and (2), there are numbers a ≻ 0 and b such that u' = au + b

The Allais Paradoxon
	Choice 1:
		A: a cheap car for sure
		B: nothing (1%), expensive car (10%) or cheap car (89%)

		Intuition: Choice A
	Choice 2:
		E: a cheap car (11%) or nothing (89%)
		F: an expensive car (10%) or nothing (90%)

		Intuition: Choice F

The Ellsberg Paradoxon
	An urn contains 90 balls. 30 of these balls are red. The remaining 60 balls are either blue or yellow.
	Choice 1:
		G: three nights in a luxury hotel in St. Petersburg if a red ball is drawn
		H: three nights in a luxury hotel in St. Petersburg if a blue ball is drawn

		General preference: G
		Conclusion: We don't like uncertainty.

Both Paradoxons invalidate the Independence axiom.
In most cases you don't know the probabilities precisely - uncertainty.

Topic 7: Voting
---------------

Given a ranking of the values {A, B, C} by different entities. Which is the most preferable overall ranking?

Pairwise Comparisons / Condorcet Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compare every two values and order the value accordingly:

= = =
1 4 2
- - -
A A B
B C C
C B A
= = =

========== =====
comparison score
---------- -----
A beats B   5:2
C beats B   4:3
A beats C   5:2
========== =====

Therefore the ranking A (first), C, B (last) is the best.
A ≺ C ≺ B.

Borda Count
~~~~~~~~~~~

Assign 0 to the lowest ranked option. Assign 1 to the second-lowest ranked option. etc.
Multiply the score with the number of supporters.

= = =
1 4 2
- - -
A A B
B C C
C B A
= = =

Score(A) = 2 * 1 + 2 * 4 + 0 * 2 = 10
Score(B) = 1 * 1 + 0 * 4 + 2 * 2 = 5
Score(C) = 0 * 1 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 2 = 6

Therefore the ranking A, C, B is the best.
A ≺ C ≺ B.

Majority Voting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

= = =
1 4 2

5 people ranked A first.
2 people ranked B first.
No one ranked C first.

A ≺ B ≺ C.

2-approval voting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider only the two highest ranked votings.
Count the supporters.

1 4 2
- - -
A A B

C B A
= = =

Score(A) = 1 + 4 = 5
Score(B) = 1 + 2 = 3
Score(C) = 2 + 4 = 6

C ≺ A ≺ B

Properties of Voting Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anonymity
  Changing the preference orderings of two group members does not affect the outcome of the aggregation.
Neutrality
  The names of the options do not matter, that is, if two options are exchanged in every individual ordering, then the outcome of the aggregation changes accordingly.
Positive Responsiveness
  If option A is tied for the win and moves up in one of the individual orderings, then option A is the unique winner.

Mayes' theorem (1952):
  An aggregation method for choosing between two options satisfies
  1. Anonymity
  2. Neutrality
  3. Positive Responsiveness
  if and only if it is the majority rule.

Universal Domain
  No preference ordering over the options can be ignored by an aggregation method.
Pareto
  If all group members prefer option A to option B, then the group prefers option A to option B.
Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives
  The social ordering of two options A and B depends only on the relative orderings of A and B for each group member.
Non-Dictatorship
  The group ordering cannot simply mimic the preferences of a single group member.

For a finite set of group members and at least three distinct options, there is no method to satisfy all last four properties.

Optimal aggregation procedure: Bayesian Procedure:
1. Start with the priors q1, …, q4.
2. Take the judgments of the (partially reliable) council members as evidence.
3. Update the priors using Bayes' Theorem taking the evidence into account.
4. Select the situation with the highest posterior probability.

Topic 8: Quantum Theory
-----------------------

Different theories to explain quantum behavior:
* The Copenhagen Interpretation
* Bohmian Mechanics

For two binary random variables we get the permutations
  P(A=1,B=1), P(A=-1,B=1), P(A=1,B=-1), P(A=-1,B=-1)
we can define a joint probability distribution using these permutations.
Therefore, P(1, 1) + P(1, -1) + P(-1, 1) + P(-1, -1) = 1

Notation. P(a, b) = P(a ∧ b)

Expectation of random variables A and B:
	E(A) = P(1,1) + P(1,-1) - P(-1,1) - P(-1,-1)
	E(B) = P(1,1) - P(1,-1) + P(-1,1) - P(-1,-1)

Variance of a random variable A:
    V(A) = E(A²) - (E(A))²

Covariance of a random variable A and B:
	cov(A,B) = E((A - E(A)) * (B - E(B))) = E(A,B) - E(A) * E(B)

Statistical independence implies
	P(A,B) = P(A) * P(B)
	⇒ cov(A,B) = 0

E(AB) = x implies P(1,1) - P(1,-1) - P(-1,1) + P(-1,-1) = x

Let's consider 4 random variables A,B,C and D:
	if E(A,B) = E(A,D) = E(C,B) = x; E(C,D) = x; x = 1/√2
	There is no joint probability distribution over all four variables
	This follows from the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Theorem

Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Theorem:
	There is a joint distribution over the random variables A, B, C, D
	with E(A) = E(B) = E(C) = E(D) = 0 if and only if
		|E(AB) + E(AD) + E(CB) - E(CD)| ≤ 2

Boolean Logic:
	* Associativity of AND
	* Associativity of OR
	* Commutativity of AND
	* Commutativity of OR
	* Distributivity of AND over OR

Measurements modify the spins of electrons.
