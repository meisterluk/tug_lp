====================

:course:    "Strategic Management" by Open2Study
:lecturer:  Mo Kader
:date:      July 2013

General
-------

- Long-term planning (at least 5 years) with big decisions
- does not focus on ops or finanical decision ("operational management"), but competitors and firm strategy
- smaller business plans (per year) should show smaller steps ("strategic alignment")

Applications of SM:
- Exporting / Expanding business
- Merges & Acquisition

Ressources of a firm:
- Internal ressources (human ressources, finances, intellectual property)
- External ressources (brand reputation, contracts)

Tactics
  small, short-term decisions
Scouting
  Observing / Looking into the structure of a firm (especially externally)
SM Planning
  Scouting. Attacking or defending? Take a strategy. Devise and implement.

Porter's Five Forces
--------------------

Five forces shaping the competitive structure of a firm.

Force 1
  Threat of substitute products
Force 2
  Bargaining Power of Buyers
Force 3
  Bargaining Power of suppliers
Force 4
  Rivalry among established firms
Force 5
  Threat of new entrants

Competition
-----------

* Scouting to estimate future activity of competitors
* Forward movement in time (what's in the future?), upwords movement in activity (what are the important changes)
* Defensive strategies are inward looking. Attacking strategies are outward looking.

Firm decisions and structure
----------------------------

Supply Chain: transport, firm providing parts of the product
Value Chain: resellers, retailers, distribution

Pricing:
* Ideal for customer: little price, high value
* Ideal for supplier: high price, acceptable value

Three pricing strategies:
1. High-price strategy (high price, limited quantity, high value)
2. Low-price strategy (low price, low value for supplier)
3. Market conditioned price (adaptive price)

Too little quality of the product can lead to {brand recognition, loss of market share, loss of reputation}. Differentiation of competitors is important.

External Strategic Management
-----------------------------

... is the Strategic Management related to all elements which are visible from the outside (product). Has to visualize external environment. External factors are more difficult to control. 

Direct competition
  A firm selling the same product or services.
Indirect competition
  Competition coming from different industries.

MNC = Multi-National Companies (spending more time on strategy)
SME = small/medium enterprise (spending more time on tactics)

* Aggressive competition (quick and with big measures)
* Defensive competition (wait & see)
* Universal competition (all risks competition, use everything we have at our disposal)

Response = competitive behavior

Firm representation
-------------------

* Mission (precise steps to achieve vision)
* Vision (eg. global, profits, variety)
* Direction (strength with which you apply your mission)

Stackholders
------------

Affected by the actions of the firm.

Internal stackholders
  Employees
External stackholders
  Shareholders, Investors, supply chain members
  Capital market stakeholders, product stakeholders, industry stakeholders

Profits
-------

* Define profit pool
* Estimate profit pool
* Value profit pool
* Reconcile profit pool

External strategies
-------------------

* intended (conscious decision to react, planning, generally overestimated)
* emergent (either emerge from a completely intended or planned strategy  OR  coincidental strategy)
* coincidental ("serendipity", based on luck and chance)

Competitive strategies
----------------------

Competitive strategies include responses to:

* Internal strategies
  * Financial
  * Technical
* External strategies

Brand loyalty helps us against the threat of new entrants. In particular the following aspects make entering a market difficult:
1. Entrance barriers (starting a business is difficult)
2. Brand loyalty (customers are conserative)
3. Cost advantages (long-standing businesses can demand higher prices)
4. Economies of scale (once a wide customer stack was established, production is easier)
5. Switching costs (eg. if production is expensive, we can save some money from marketing; so overall we don't increase the price)
6. Government regulation (laws affecting your business might change)

Competition factors for rivalry
-------------------------------

If one of those factors increases, rivalry among established firms will increase.

* Extent
* Profit
* Growth
* Costs (fixed costs are unsexy in management)
* Exit barrier
* What's at stake (saving the face when leaving a market in terms of reputation, brand or finance)

Aspects for Bargaining Power of Buyers
--------------------------------------

Less differentiation / negotiation means higher bargaining power of buyers.

* The number of buyers
* The number of sellers
* Standardized products (more standardization, more bargaining power for the buyers)
* Backwards integration into the industry (high backward integration means product is connected with subscription for other products)
* Multiple sources of supply

Aspects for Bargaining Power of Suppliers
-----------------------------------------

High forward integration leads to higher bargaining power for suppliers.

* Make production cheap
* Make yourself irreplaceable

Supply Chains and Competitive Behaviour
---------------------------------------

A good supplier gives us a competitiveness in our market.
A good supply chain will lead to a good value chain.

Management errors
-----------------

Ivory tower planning
  Management decision made without consulting the employees.
  Typical for firm with strong hierarchies.
  Not so typical for marketing or strongly technical firms.
Procedural justice
  Management make decision because they think they establish fair rules.
  They are leaving out other important aspects (beside fairness,
  ie. operational possible and profitable).
  Typical for firms in little competition
  (focuses on fairness of internal ressources).
Fit model
  Firm limits its abilities to expand. They avoid changing with the market.
  Typical for small firms.

Management decision barriers
----------------------------

Group think
  If a large group of people come to a decision, some people will have
  a different opinion and will not support it.
  Based on internal factors.
Cognitive bias
  People are not sure which decision to support.
  Based on internal factors.
Prior hypothesis
  Manager makes decision about market before it's visible.
  Hypothesis is based on old legacy knowledge.
  Based on internal and external factors.

Commitment errors
-----------------

Escalating commitment
  Commitment of further resources even when a project is failing,
  simply as a result of the resources that have been committed yet.
  Typical for plastics manufacturing, fashion firms and hotels.

Reasoning & Representation errors
---------------------------------

Manager prefers a possible decision just because he knows it the best.
Typical for suppliers and young firms.

How to improve Strategic Decision Making
----------------------------------------

Devil's advocacy
  If there are several strategic managers, make them specialize on particular area
  (geographical markets or product areas within the firm). If two divisions are
  struggling for more ressources, use "devil's advocacy". This means that a
  third party (SM) will try to allocate ressources from both parties and will
  recognize which party deserves the ressources more.
Dialectic enquiry
  Dialectic enquiry means several representative people debate which one gets
  the most ressources.

Conditions affecting decision making:
* political (structure of firm, agressiveness)
* ressources within the firm (defines importance of decisions)

Corporate duties
----------------

Duties and expectations of company by shareholders (internal and external player) and external people.
Eg. making the profit expected by shareholders.
Duty of a SM: Preserve the rights of each entity associated with the firm (shareholders, stakeholders, etc)

Ethics in Strategic Management
------------------------------

1. Ethos: belief system of the firm, how the company thinks
2. Business culture: regulates the relation between the company and its competitors (honest, fair, balanced)
3. Business model: how the company distributes its products and services
